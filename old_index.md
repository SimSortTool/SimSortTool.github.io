![logo](./logo.png)


SimSort is a deep learningâ€“based framework for spike sorting, using large-scale simulated electrophysiology simulations.

Currently, SimSort supports spike sorting for Tetrode (4-channels) recordings. 

SimSort 2.0 for NeuroPixels is on the way!

## Use SimSort with [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

```python
import numpy as np
